Caution: there is no overlap/duplicate of data. For instance if a FAO area for a fishing country is repeated, this means that the data correspond to various LME and/or EEZ inside the FAO area, and the whole Effort/Catch in the FAO is the sum of all values given.

"FAO": The generic name of the FAO area in which the Effort/Catch is occurring
"FAOnbr": A number code to the FAO area, as per FAO notation
"EEZ": The EEZ / high seas name in which the Effort/Catch is occurring
"LME": The generic name of the Large Marine ecosystem in which the Effort/Catch is occurring
"LMEnbr": A number code to the LME, as per NOAA notation
"FGroup": Functional Group of the target species
"Year": Year (end of the year) when the Effort/Catch is occurring
"Fcountry": Fishing country, in ISO3 notation. Ex supranational entities (USSR, Yugoslavia) are disaggregated to their constituent countries. Serbian Fishing Effort included with Montenegro.
"Sector": Fishing sector (artisanal/industrial), defined by the law of the country (varies by country)
"NomEffReported": Nominal (i.e. not including the technological creep) fishing effort corresponding to the reported catch (kW.days)
"NomEffIUU": Nominal (i.e. not including the technological creep) fishing effort corresponding to the illegal catch and discards (kW.days)
"Reported": Reported catch (tons, total for the area)
"IUUs": Illegal catch / discards (tons, total for the area)
"AreaSqKm2": water surface area (km2). 
"NbrCells": Number of 0.5 degree cell making up the area.

"NomEffTotal": Total nominal fishing effort (artisanal and industrial, including reported and IUU), by country and year. Unmapped, non gear specific
"EnginePowerkW": Total engine power equivalent of the fishing fleet, by country and year. The non-motorised fleet was given an engine power equivalent to half the engine power of small (powered) vessels of that country (approx 2kW/vessel).
"NumberVessels": Number of fishing vessels by country and year.
