## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to create time series of F for the therMizer FishMIP runs.  There are three fishing scenarios:
* histsoc: varying direct human influences in the historical period (1950-2014) (i.e., historical estimates of fishing effort)
* 2015soc: fixed year-2015 direct human influences (i.e., fishing effort)
* nat: no fishing (naturalized run)
and the histsoc and 2015soc scenarios will be appended

Modified from Woodworth-Jefcoats

## Fishing Mortality

Here, we will read in the fishing mortality estimates obtained from ICES stock assessments. Orginally the model has been claibrated with older estimates also from the same ICES database but I have updated this to enable the time series to extend to 2015.


```{r}
# We'll do this in three pieces 1950-1956, 1957-2010, 2011-2100
# Read saved data form Blanchard et al 2014 (ICES stock assessments - NOTE: will be updated with new updated values that extened to 2014, 2015 is part of the scenario)

f_history<-as(read.csv("fmat.csv", row.names=1), "matrix")[as.character(1957:2010),]

initial_effort <- matrix(f_history[1, ], byrow = TRUE, nrow = 7,
                         ncol = ncol(f_history), dimnames = list(1950:1956))

initial_effort ["1950",] <- 0

for (i in 1:12) initial_effort [as.character(1950:1956),i] <- seq(from = initial_effort ["1950",i], to = initial_effort ["1956",i], length = 1956-1950+1)

# check that has worked
initial_effort

# future - hold at 201 values - UPDATE THIS

future_effort <- matrix(f_history["2010", ], byrow = TRUE, nrow = 90,
                         ncol = ncol(f_history), dimnames = list(2011:2100))


FishingEffort <- rbind(initial_effort, f_history, future_effort)


# Save output

saveRDS(FishingEffort, file = "FishingEffort.RDS")
