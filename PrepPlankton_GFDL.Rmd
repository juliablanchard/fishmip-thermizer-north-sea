## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to create time series of plankton spectra for the therMizer FishMIP runs.  There are four climate scenarios:
* picontrol: pre-industrial climate as simulated by the Earth System Models (ESMs)
* historical: historical climate as simulated by the ESMs, starting in 1950
* ssp126: SSP1-RCP2.6 climate as simulated by the ESMs
* ssp585" SSP5-RCP8.5 climate as simulated by the ESMs
and both ssp126 and ssp585 will be appended to historical.  Note that only the years 1950 - 2100 are needed.
